${\color{YellowOrange}\textbf{ASTR 29800:}}$
> **CMB_fitting.ipynb**: Compares bose-einstein and steady-state models for the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) using monopole spectrum data from COBE/FIRAS. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to optimize the fit of the model to the data.



## CLASS DESCRIPTIONS
${\color{Thistle}\textbf{DATA 22100:}}$ [spring 2024](http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/datascience/)
> This course introduces topics in current applications of machine learning for Data Science minor students. Topics include machine learning models, supervised and unsupervised learning, loss functions, risk, empirical risk and overfitting, regression and classification, clustering, gradient boosting, decision trees and random forests, and a brief introduction to Neural Networks and deep learning.

${\color{YellowGreen}\textbf{BIOS 10140:}}$ [spring 2024](http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/biologicalsciencescore/)
> In this course students will be able to conduct their own research projects to experience how biologists frame questions and test hypotheses. This inquiry-based approach permits students to learn fundamental biological principles while carrying out scientific experiments and expanding our knowledge of living systems. Classes will take place in the lab, integrating lectures, discussions, and experiments in active sessions, thus eliminating the separation between theory and practice. Students will also have an opportunity to develop communication skills during the quarter, presenting their proposals and results to their peers and instructors. Each course instructor will focus their section on a different major problem in the biological sciences that will frame the students' research questions.


${\color{Thistle}\textbf{DATA 11900:}}$ [winter 2024](http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/datascience/)
> This course is the second quarter of a two-quarter systematic introduction to the foundations of data science, as well as to practical considerations in data analysis. A broad background on probability and statistical methodology will be provided. More advanced topics on data privacy and ethics, reproducibility in science, data encryption, and basic machine learning will be introduced. We will explore these concepts with real-world problems from different domains.


${\color{YellowOrange}\textbf{ASTR 29800:}}$ [spring 2023](http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/astronomyastrophysics/)
> In this course students will engage with various scientific practices to prepare them for participation in research. Students will critically analyze research presented in popular and scholarly scientific literature and practice computational, statistical, and observational techniques to explore astrophysical problems. The course will emphasize student-led discussions and interactive presentations to synthesize previous coursework and strengthen scientific thinking and communication skills. Guest lectures by members of research groups will highlight projects undertaken by faculty in Astronomy and Astrophysics to acquaint students with possibilities for research participation.
